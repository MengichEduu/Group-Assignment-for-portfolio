Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a showcase of my skills, projects, and accomplishments as a software engineer. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the code organized into separate folders for better structure and maintainability.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

B:\Python Projects\Edom Mengich Portfolio Extracted\Edom Mengich Portfolio │ ├── index-2.html # Main HTML file for the portfolio webpage ├── B:\Python Projects\Edom Mengich Portfolio Extracted\Edom Mengich Portfolio\css # Folder containing the CSS files │ └── styles.css # Main stylesheet for the webpage │ ├── B:\Python Projects\Edom Mengich Portfolio Extracted\Edom Mengich Portfolio\js # Folder containing JavaScript files │ └── scripts.js # JavaScript file for functionality and interactions │ └── B:\Python Projects\Edom Mengich Portfolio Extracted\Edom Mengich Portfolio\images # Folder containing images used in the portfolio.
